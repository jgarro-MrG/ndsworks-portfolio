    title: 'Why I Chose the PERN Stack for This Portfolio',
    content: 'The PERN stack offers a complete end-to-end JavaScript solution, which simplifies development and context-switching. React\'s component-based architecture is fantastic for building a scalable UI, while Node.js and Express make creating a robust back-end API straightforward. Finally, PostgreSQL\'s relational structure, managed with the Sequelize ORM, provides a reliable and structured foundation for content-focused applications like this one.',

    title: 'The Importance of System Architecture',
    content: 'Before writing a single line of code for ndsworks.com, I mapped out the system architecture using the MVC pattern. This separation of concerns is critical for long-term maintainability. The Model handles data, the View handles the UI, and the Controller handles the logic connecting them. This clarity prevents code from becoming a tangled mess and makes debugging significantly easier.',
