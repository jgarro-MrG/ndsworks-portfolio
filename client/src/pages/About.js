      <div className="space-y-4 text-slate-700 text-justify">
        <p>For some, a career path is a straight line. For Jorge Garro, it has been a journey of pragmatic adaptation, driven by a deep sense of purpose. From corporate enterprise systems to the classroom and back to pure engineering, his path reveals a professional who is part engineer, part educator, and a true problem-solver at heart, now poised to build the next chapter of his career in software development.</p>
        <p>The journey began not with code, but with sound. An early dream to become a sound engineer led him to study electronics, drawn to the hardware and circuits behind the music. Life and professional demands required a practical pivot. Influenced by his father, a self-taught systems analyst, Jorge transitioned to Information Systems, launching a successful career in corporate IT where he supported complex systems for major enterprises.</p>
        <p>Seeking a new challenge that would leverage his expertise in a different way, Jorge embraced an opportunity to step into the world of education. As an instructor in digital media and software development, he discovered a passion for mentorship, translating complex technical topics into foundational lessons for the next generation. This experience honed his ability to communicate with clarity and purpose, skills that are invaluable in any technical team.</p>
        <p>Through all these transitions, a core philosophy has been his guide. "I'm always driven by helping others, to define problems and solving them," he explains. This ethos of service is complemented by a powerful technical principle he draws from his passion as a musician. "Everything has a structure," he says. "There are patterns that when used correctly, can create beautiful amazing things... but it's always important not to add what is not necessary." This belief in elegant, essential design is the hallmark of a true engineer.</p>
        <p>Today, Jorge is preparing for his next evolution. With a goal of becoming a full-stack developer or data engineer, he isn’t focused on a single trendy technology stack. "I want to be somebody who understands the whole system, front to back, back to front," he asserts. His passion lies in the complex, foundational challenges of back-end development and data engineering.</p>
        <p>Jorge Garro's story is not just about changing jobs; it’s about a deliberate and purposeful navigation of a multi-faceted career. It’s a testament to a professional who learns by researching, creating, and teaching, all while engineering a better future.</p>
